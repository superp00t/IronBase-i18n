## Adding a language

Copy enUS.js to xxXX.js (replace xxXX with your ISO language code).

Replace all right-hand English string assignments in the xxXX.js object with your native language. Proper nouns such as "Cleave" and "IronBase" can be left as-is. 

Finally, credit yourself in the file as well as the README!
